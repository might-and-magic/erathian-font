Erathia Font Version 1.0:

By tomchen1989


I believe HoMM III and MM7 Players can hardly forget the memorable time in Erathia. But, do you really know the language of Erathia? You can't survive if you don't even speak the language there!

When we are talking to the local people or watching the guideboard in the game MM7, in surprise, we can find that people in Erathia use English +_+ .Same pronunciation but the different characters. So, here is the Erathia language font made by me. Hope you enjoy it and write in Erathia language without any trouble.

Look at the eng_era_mapping.png to know how it works. The other characters like the numerals and the punctuation marks use times new roman font.


Copy the Erathia.ttf to your system font folder C:\WINDOWS\Fonts, then you can use it.




Distribute the Erathia.ttf with this readme file.
